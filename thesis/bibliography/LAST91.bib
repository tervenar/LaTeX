   abstract = {The purpose of this note is to identify the space-time Martin boundary for a nearest-neighbor random walk on a homogeneous tree. For simplicity we shall only consider trees of a certain type, to wit, Cayley graphs of free products of the two-element group ℤ2. However, the techniques developed here are applicable also to certain other trees, e.g., Cayley graphs of finitely generated free groups, and the space-time Martin boundaries in such cases admit similar descriptions. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},
