% main body
Periodic splines were first introduced in [REFERENCE]. \\
Application include medicine, statistics, aeronautics [REFERENCES]. \\

In the theory of differential equations they are used to obtain approximations for integral and differential operators [REFERENCES]. \\

Classical splines were used to construct and compute wavelets [REFERENCES]. Wavelet properties: localization in time and frequency space, differentiability order, approximation order, symmetry properties, decay behavior. \\
Wavelets applications [REFERENCES]. \\
Wavelet generalizations: there are already some variants and generalizations of wavelet bases such as wavelet packets, multiwavelets, multivariate wavelets, wavelet frames, curvelets and others [REFERENCES] \\

Fractional and complex versions of classical non-periodic polynomial B-splines were introduced in \cite{UnBl00, For+06}. \\

Fractional non-periodic spline wavelets were considered in \cite{UnBl99, UnBl00}. \\

MOTIVATION: for complex and fractional versions, periodization. Multiresolution analysis applications [REFERENCES]. \\

The relation of B-splines and multiresolution analysis was elaborated in \cite{For11}. Periodization technique for complex B-splines was introduced in \cite{For12}. \\

% description of the document structure
In chapter \ref{chap:I} we introduce the notion of a multiresolution analysis and explore the techniques for periodization of orthogonal scaling functions and wavelets. \\
In chapter \ref{chap:II} we review current results on the construction of periodic cardinal wavelets from cardinal B-splines. \\
Finally, exploiting the results for periodic complex B-splines, in chapter \ref{chap:III} we construct periodic complex B-spline wavelets and prove some of their characterizations including semi-orthogonality and Riesz bounds. \\
